## Wine data, *k*-means clustering

[View R Markdown file](https://github.com/ds4m/ds4m.github.io/tree/master/chapter-5-resources/3-wine-data-k-means.Rmd)

To run that R Markdown file on your own machine, you would need the associated
data file in the same folder as the `.Rmd` file.
[You can get the data file here.](https://github.com/ds4m/ds4m.github.io/tree/master/chapter-5-resources/winedata.txt)

## Wine data, model-based clustering

[View R Markdown file](https://github.com/ds4m/ds4m.github.io/tree/master/chapter-5-resources/5-wine-data-model-based.Rmd)

To run that R Markdown file on your own machine, you would need the associated
data file in the same folder as the `.Rmd` file.
[You can get the data file here.](https://github.com/ds4m/ds4m.github.io/tree/master/chapter-5-resources/winedata.txt)
You will also need a file containing BIC values, which you should also place
in the same folder as the `.Rmd` file.
[You can get that second file here.](https://github.com/ds4m/ds4m.github.io/tree/master/chapter-5-resources/mclustBICs.csv)
