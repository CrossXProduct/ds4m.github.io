## Markdown example

Figure 2.1 of the text shows example uses of
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) in a
mathematical document.  You can view that document in several ways here.

 * [As a Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ds4m/ds4m.github.io/tree/master/chapter-2-resources/Figure_2_1.ipynb)
 * [Rendered to PDF from Jupyter](https://github.com/ds4m/ds4m.github.io/tree/master/chapter-2-resources/Figure_2_1_ipynb.pdf)
 * [As an RMarkdown file](https://github.com/ds4m/ds4m.github.io/tree/master/chapter-2-resources/Figure_2_1.Rmd)
 * [Knit to PDF from R](https://github.com/ds4m/ds4m.github.io/tree/master/chapter-2-resources/Figure_2_1_Rmd.pdf)

## Notebook examples

Figures 2.2 through 2.4 of the text show example notebooks.  You can view those
notebooks online here.

 * [RMarkdown notebook from Figures 2.2 and 2.3](https://github.com/ds4m/ds4m.github.io/tree/master/chapter-2-resources/My_Awesome_R_Notebook.Rmd)
 * [That notebook rendered to PDF](https://github.com/ds4m/ds4m.github.io/tree/master/chapter-2-resources/My_Awesome_R_Notebook.pdf)
 * [Jupyter notebook from Figure 2.4](https://github.com/ds4m/ds4m.github.io/tree/master/chapter-2-resources/My_Awesome_Jupyter_Notebook.ipynb)
 * [That notebook rendered to PDF](https://github.com/ds4m/ds4m.github.io/tree/master/chapter-2-resources/My_Awesome_Jupyter_Notebook.pdf)

## Code examples

Section 2.3 shows many small snippets of code while teaching coding best
practices.  Some are written in R and some in Python.  The documents below
contain those code snippets together with paragraphs from the text that explain
them.

 * [RMarkdown document with R code from Section 2.3](https://github.com/ds4m/ds4m.github.io/tree/master/chapter-2-resources/R_code.Rmd)
    * In order to function, that document needs
      [this R code file](https://github.com/ds4m/ds4m.github.io/tree/master/chapter-2-resources/parity_test_file.R)
      in the same folder.
 * [That same document rendered to a PDF](https://github.com/ds4m/ds4m.github.io/tree/master/chapter-2-resources/R_code.pdf)
 * [Jupyter notebook with Python code from Section 2.3](https://github.com/ds4m/ds4m.github.io/tree/master/chapter-2-resources/Python_code.ipynb)
 * [That same notebook rendered to a PDF](https://github.com/ds4m/ds4m.github.io/tree/master/chapter-2-resources/Python_code.pdf)
