## Boston Housing Dataset Example

The chapter includes code that loads a built-in
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) dataset of Boston housing
prices from 1978 and fits a linear model using appropriate train/test
splitting and simple feature selection.  (The dataset's origins are documented
[here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#boston-house-prices-dataset).)
